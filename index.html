            <h2>About Us</h2>     
                  <p>This is a lil example blurb of a little message we would write about the club. Since [what year], the uchicago bridge team has been 
                  dealing, bidding, and eating goldfish. We love the game of bridge and would like to share it with everyone. 
                   Sometimes we compete against schools in tournaments. We meet thursdays at 8 in hutch commons (a new location tbd).
