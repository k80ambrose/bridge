            <h2>About Us</h2>     
                  <p>This is a lil example blurb of a blurb we would write about the club. Since [what year this was founded], the uchicago bridge team has been 
                  dealing, bidding too high, and eating goldfish. We love to play the game of bridge and would like to share it with everyone. We use 2/1 bidding. 
                   Sometimes we compete against other schools in tournaments. We meet thursdays at 8 in hutch commons (a new location tbd).     </p>
